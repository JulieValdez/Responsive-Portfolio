          Hi. I am 45 years old and have a 21 year old son. He is a mechanical
          engineering major at UCSD. The picture you see to the right is my
          newest little monster Bill Murray. :) Technically he was not allowed
          to go in IKEA...but I am not the best rule follower. He had a great
          time and helped me pick out some truly fantastic coffee cups.

          I have worked for the last 18 years in the public school system, at
          both district offices and in the insurance field providing coverage
          for school employees. I currently work at a small high school district
          in Taft, CA in the Central Valley. I live in Bakersfield, but commute
          everyday. If you have never heard of Taft, don't worry, you aren't
          alone...but this tiny town is the epicenter of some of the largest oil
          reserves in the nation. Yes, nation! And was part of the Teapot Dome
          scandal in the 1920's.

          When I am not at my regular job or pulling my hair out trying to learn
          how to do this homeowrk assignment, I teach group fitness. I teach a
          Les Mills format called BodyCombat. Google it, it's fun :)
